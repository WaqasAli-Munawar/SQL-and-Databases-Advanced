For example, on Facebook, one process might handle updating user information, and another might handle generating the news feed.\n",
    "* We can't take advantage of performance features, such as **caching**. Because a **SQLite database** is a single file, and it doesn't require a special program to run, it can't have performance optimizations like **caching**. When running a site like `Facebook` that has a ton of traffic, it's important to be able to lookup data quickly.\n",
    "* **SQLite** doesn't have any built-in security. With a production website, it's common to want some people to be able to modify tables in a database (`write`), and others to only be able to make `SELECT` queries to tables in the database (`read`). This is because giving someone **write access** to the database can be a security risk, in that they can update or overwrite data. **SQLite** doesn't allow for restricting access to a database in this way."
